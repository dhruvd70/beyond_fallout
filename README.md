# BEYOND FALLOUT

Text Based Adventure Game Written in C.

## Description

The game takes place in a modern, post-apocalyptic world ravaged by nuclear fallout. Cities
lie in ruin, twisted metal structures loom like skeletal remains, and the landscape is littered
with radioactive zones. Nature has taken back much of the world, but the animals and plants
that remain have mutated—becoming both beautiful and deadly. Society has collapsed, and
pockets of survivors are scattered, but traveling from one place to another is dangerous and
often fatal.
The protagonist, Eli, is one such survivor—a lone scavenger with a mission to cross the
wasteland and reach a distant city called Haven. It is rumored to be a refuge where survivors
are rebuilding society. Eli’s only hope lies in making it to Haven, but between him and
salvation are days of harsh travel, poisonous air, hostile scavengers, and the most dangerous
threat of all—mutated creatures driven mad by radiation.
